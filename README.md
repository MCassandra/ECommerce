# ECommerce BackEnd


## Description
This application has front-end starter code for an e-commerce site. This aplication uses Express.js, Sequalize, dotenv, and mySQL2 for the back end. I am also using Insomnia Core to view api routes. 

## How it works
1. Clone this repository  
2. In the terminal paste the repository   
3. npm install  
4. Set your environment variables   
5. Run mySQL with your credentials  
6. Run seeds with node seeds/index.js  
7. Start the server with node server.js
8. Open Insomnia Core to test GET, PUT, POST, DELETE routes
